<h2> What is Football?</h2>
<p>Football is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. Each team tries to get more points than their opponents. In order to do that, they must score a "touchdown." A touchdown is when at least one player from a team reaches the other side of the field with the ball in their hands. The game keeps playing until the four quarters have been completed. Then, the points are tallied up, and the winner is announced!</p>
